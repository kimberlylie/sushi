# sushi
A webapp for ordering takeout sushi.

A project for EE4717 Web Application and Design course at Nanyang Technological University.

Pics Folder - All the pictures that will be needed for the webapp. This folder will be broken down further into 3 sub-folders for Index, Menu and Contact. To make sure that the pictures are organized in their respective folders.

sushi.css - External stylesheet for the webapp which houses all the styles across the pages. So, all the id names must be unique across the 3 pages + cart page. Header, nav styling should be uniform across including background color (white).
